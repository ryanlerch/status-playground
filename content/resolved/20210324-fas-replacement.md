Replacement of FAS2 with the new Fedora Accounts  All Fedora Services will be affected.

As this is the authentication system there may be issues logging in to some services. Users 
may not be able to access people.fedoraproject.org or secondary.fedoraproject.org during the 
outage. Maintainer test instances are a special case and as such will be in a "frozen" state 
for access after the outage. This means that no updates will be made to users or ssh keys on 
these machines.
